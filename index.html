    <p>I will be honest. I didn't work hard enough yesterday so I'm kinda lost during today's session.  I need more time to read through the documentations and watch lesson videos again</p>
    <p>I am going to work really hard tonight. Hopefully I will able to deliver the assignment by tommorrow session</p>
