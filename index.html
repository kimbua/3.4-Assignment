    <p>I have to be honest, I didn't work hard enough yesterday so I wasn't on a same page with everyone during today's session.  I need more time to read through the documentations and watch lesson videos again</p>
    <p>I apologize, I've been very slow since week2. I'm gonna work really hard tonight and hopefully I would be able to deliver the assignment by tommorrow lesson so I could once again enjoy the fun of coding.</p>
